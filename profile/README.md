## Hi there 👋

Mindstorms for Train Simulators is a system of devices that utilzies Lego Mindstorms EV3 bricks to control cab systems for Train Simulator Classic, Train Simulator World, and OpenBVE.

## Get Involved 🌈

Lego Mindstorms was discontinued in 2022, meaning that, although there are still a lot of systems still running, this system will need to be ported to newer Spike PRIME kits, if anyone is interested in joining. There is also a possibility of using Raspberry Pi HATS that utilizes the newer LPF2 ports, doing away with the technic hubs alltogether. 
Unfortunately, I do not have the money or interest in buying the Spike PRIME kit myself.
